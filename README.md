This map uses react-map-gl, deck.gl, mapbox, to display a navigation map on the page, with route guidance 
and visible routes on the map. Estimations of time and distance for routes are available. 

This project uses extensive state manipulation and several API calls for infor mation such as 
locations, directions, and coordinates. 

Some calculations include the distance as the crow flies from your current location to your next desired
coordinate. 

This is not only an excellent exercise in react, but in research, react components, API calls, storing information, 
and reading documentation. 

This map was developed for use in our final group project, a moving app called Muber. Muber and this map are 
under continual development.
